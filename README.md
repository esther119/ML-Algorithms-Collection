### Background 
K-means algoritm is unsupervised machine learning algoritm used to claster t    he data. The number of clusters is predefined. Steps in algoritm:
1) Pick centroid of every cluster by randomly sampling points from the dataset
2) Calculate the euclidean distance between centroid and points
3) By smallest distance attach each point to the cluster
4) Update the centroids by calculating the mean of the points in the cluster
